# 🔧 Kaniko Fix Summary - SentraTech Deployment

**Fix Applied:** October 2, 2025, 10:22 UTC  
**Issue:** "Couldn't find a package.json file in '/app'"

---

## 🎯 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

**Problem:** Kaniko was looking for package.json at `/app` but configuration was unclear about root build context.

**Solution Applied:**
1. **Restored Git State:** Used `git checkout -- package.json` to restore original working version
2. **Simplified Configuration:** Removed BuildX references that weren't being honored by platform
3. **Confirmed Root Build:** Ensured `root: "."` points to `/app` where package.json exists
4. **Verified Build Command:** `yarn build:website` works perfectly from root

## ✅ CURRENT CONFIGURATION

### emergent.config.js - Website Section
```javascript
{
  name: "website",
  root: ".",                                              // Build from /app root
  buildCommand: "yarn install --frozen-lockfile && yarn build:website",
  output: "packages/website/dist",                        // Output to correct location
  domains: ["sentratech.net", "www.sentratech.net"]
}
```

### package.json - Root Level (/app/package.json)
```json
{
  "name": "sentratech-monorepo",
  "scripts": {
    "build:website": "cd packages/website && yarn install --frozen-lockfile && yarn build"
  },
  "workspaces": {
    "packages": ["packages/*", "server"]
  }
}
```
