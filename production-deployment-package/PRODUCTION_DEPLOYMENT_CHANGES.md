# Production Deployment Changes Required

## Server Information
- **Production Server IP**: 35.57.15.54
- **Production URL**: https://sentratech.net/
- **Current Environment**: Preview server (34.16.56.64) - Changes made here need to be deployed to production

## Changes Made That Need Production Deployment

### 1. ROI Calculator Performance Optimizations
**Files Modified:**
- `/frontend/src/pages/ROICalculatorPage.js` 
- `/frontend/src/components/ROICalculatorRedesigned.js`
- `/frontend/src/index.css`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Replaced expensive Framer Motion `whileInView` animations with CSS-only animations
- ✅ Removed costly `blur-3xl` effects in background accents
- ✅ Optimized transition properties from `transition-all duration-200` to targeted `smooth-hover` classes
- ✅ Added performance-optimized CSS classes: `animate-fade-in`, `animate-slide-up`, `btn-optimized`
- ✅ Reduced animation duration from 0.8s to 0.4s for snappier performance
- ✅ Added hardware acceleration hints and GPU optimizations

**Impact:** Fixes the reported scroll lag and slow transition effects on ROI calculator page

### 2. Investor Relations Page Updates
**File Modified:**
- `/frontend/src/pages/InvestorRelationsPage.js`

**Changes Required:**
- ✅ Update funding amount from `$2.5M` to `$80,000`
- ✅ Update timeline from `Q1 2025` to `Q1 2026`
- ✅ Remove "View Interactive Pitch Deck" button
- ✅ Remove "Contact for Investment" button  
- ✅ Keep only "Schedule Product Demo" button (styled as primary button)
- ✅ Update all milestone timelines from 2025 to 2026
- ✅ Update SEO metadata description with new funding amount

### 3. Floating Hamburger Button Removal
**Files Modified:**
- `/frontend/src/App.js`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Removed FloatingNavScrollable component (blue floating hamburger button)
- ✅ Kept the green hamburger menu in top navigation (Navigation.js unchanged for mobile menu)
- ✅ Cleaned up unused imports for FloatingNavScrollable

**Impact:** Removes the floating blue hamburger button from the middle of screens while preserving the functional green hamburger menu in the navigation bar for mobile users

### 4. Landing Page Card Effects Fix
**Files Modified:**
- `/frontend/src/pages/HomePage.js`
- `/frontend/src/index.css`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Enhanced card hover effects with transform, scale, and shadow animations
- ✅ Added CSS classes: card-hover-enhanced, icon-hover-enhanced, hover-only
- ✅ Improved feature cards with better hover feedback (scale, rotate, color changes)
- ✅ Enhanced benefits section hover effects with scale and rotation
- ✅ Added explicit CSS animations for better cross-browser compatibility

**Impact:** Fixes the reported issue where landing page cards don't move/show effects on hover

### 5. Cookie Modal Performance Fix
**File Modified:**
- `/frontend/src/components/CookieBanner.jsx`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Removed 300ms delay - cookie modal now appears instantly
- ✅ Improved loading time for better user experience
- ✅ Maintains persistence across page navigation to prevent repetition

**Impact:** Cookie modal appears immediately on first visit, doesn't repeat once accepted

### 6. Contact Sales Form Volume Range Fix
**File Modified:**
- `/frontend/src/components/ContactSalesSlideIn.js`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Fixed volume range button calculations with logical values
- ✅ Updated `<10k` range: Call Volume 2,500 + Interaction Volume 5,500 (total ≈ 8K)
- ✅ Updated `10k-50k` range: Call Volume 12,000 + Interaction Volume 18,000 (total = 30K)  
- ✅ Updated `50k+` range: Call Volume 25,000 + Interaction Volume 40,000 (total = 65K)
- ✅ Values now align logically with the selected ranges and realistic business proportions

**Impact:** Fixes the reported issue where range buttons populated wrong amounts in volume fields

## Deployment Steps Required

### Step 1: Copy Files to Production Server
The following files contain the changes and need to be deployed to 35.57.15.54:

```bash
# Frontend files with changes
frontend/src/pages/ROICalculatorPage.js
frontend/src/components/ROICalculatorRedesigned.js  
frontend/src/pages/InvestorRelationsPage.js
frontend/src/components/Navigation.js
frontend/src/App.js
frontend/src/index.css

# Verify CookieBanner is deployed
frontend/src/components/CookieBanner.jsx
```

### Step 2: Restart Services on Production
```bash
sudo supervisorctl restart frontend backend
```

### Step 3: Clear Cache and Test
```bash
# Clear any cached versions
# Test ROI calculator scroll performance
# Test Investor Relations page funding amounts and buttons
# Test cookie modal functionality
```

## Critical Notes

1. **Environment Confusion**: Currently working on preview server (34.16.56.64) but changes need to be on production server (35.57.15.54)
2. **DNS**: Ensure https://sentratech.net/ points to 35.57.15.54, not the preview server  
3. **Performance Impact**: The ROI calculator optimizations significantly improve scroll performance
4. **Business Impact**: Investor Relations changes reflect updated funding strategy ($80K vs $2.5M)

## Success Metrics
- ROI Calculator scroll performance improved (no lag reported by users)
- Investor Relations page shows correct funding information
- Cookie modal appears consistently on production environment
- All functionality preserved while performance optimized
