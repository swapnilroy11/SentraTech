## ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED ‚úÖ
The React frontend was configured with an incorrect backend URL pointing to a non-existent preview environment:
```

‚úÖ FIXED:  REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://sentratech.net
```

## BACKEND VERIFICATION COMPLETE ‚úÖ
Tested the job application API endpoint:
- ‚úÖ `/api/proxy/job-application` responding HTTP 200
- ‚úÖ Dashboard integration working
- ‚úÖ Idempotency system functional
- ‚úÖ Error handling in place

## BUSINESS IMPACT
