# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL BUG FIX - Job Application Form Deployment Instructions

## CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED
The job application form on https://sentratech.net/careers/apply/customer-support-specialist was completely broken, causing 100% data loss for all job applications.

## ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED
The frontend environment variable `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` was pointing to a non-existent preview environment instead of the production backend.

## FIX APPLIED
Updated `/frontend/.env` to use the correct production backend URL.

## DEPLOYMENT STEPS FOR PRODUCTION SERVER (35.57.15.54)

### 1. Update Frontend Environment Variables
Replace the `/frontend/.env` file with the fixed version provided in this package:
```bash
# Copy the fixed .env file
cp frontend-env-fix.env /path/to/frontend/.env
```

### 2. Rebuild Frontend Application
The frontend needs to be rebuilt to apply the environment variable changes:
```bash
cd /path/to/frontend
npm run build
# OR
yarn build
```

### 3. Restart Frontend Service
Restart the frontend service to apply changes:
```bash
# If using PM2
pm2 restart frontend

# If using systemd
sudo systemctl restart frontend

# If using docker
docker-compose restart frontend
```

### 4. Verification Steps
After deployment, verify the fix works:

1. **Navigate to:** https://sentratech.net/careers/apply/customer-support-specialist
2. **Fill out the job application form** with test data
3. **Click "Submit Application"** 
4. **Verify:** The button should now make API calls to `https://sentratech.net/api/proxy/job-application`
5. **Check:** Applications should successfully reach the admin dashboard

## TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Before (Broken):
```
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://matrix-team-update.preview.emergentagent.com
```

### After (Fixed):
```
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://sentratech.net
```

### Backend Verification
The backend API endpoint has been tested and confirmed working:
- âœ… `/api/proxy/job-application` - HTTP 200 responses
- âœ… Dashboard integration functional
- âœ… Idempotency system working
- âœ… Proper error handling

## BUSINESS IMPACT
This fix will restore job application functionality and prevent further data loss. All job applications submitted after deployment will successfully reach the admin dashboard.

## URGENT PRIORITY
This is a critical business-blocking bug. Please deploy immediately to restore job application functionality.
