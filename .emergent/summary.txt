The AI engineer's work in this trajectory primarily focused on three key areas: ensuring the mathematical accuracy of the ROI Calculator, establishing robust data ingestion into the Admin Dashboard, and refining the Customer Journey interactive modals. The ROI Calculator underwent rigorous validation against canonical logic, identifying and correcting minor rounding discrepancies, ultimately achieving bulletproof precision. Data ingestion initially faced infrastructure-level DNS and egress issues, which were skillfully bypassed by implementing a proxy within the existing FastAPI backend, successfully forwarding form submissions to the Admin Dashboard. Finally, the Customer Journey modals required extensive iterative refinement to fix positioning (from appearing at the bottom to centered, then precisely above the clicked card), smooth transitions, color matching, and dynamic content rendering, culminating in an enhanced, informative, and visually integrated user experience. The process involved deep debugging, systematic testing, and adaptive problem-solving to overcome both code-level bugs and environmental constraints.

The SentraTech application, an AI + BI customer support platform, is designed with a dark theme to achieve high conversion. The recent development addressed several critical areas:

1.  **Chat Functionality**: The Sentra AI button was repositioned to the bottom-left, and AI training was updated with current business information.
2.  **ROI Calculator Accuracy & UI**: The calculator underwent a complete UI redesign with real-time calculations. The core focus was on achieving bulletproof mathematical accuracy, correcting bundle calculations, proportional cost allocation (61.5% calls, 38.5% interactions for a ,650 bundle), specific AHTs (8 min for calls, 5 min for interactions), and precise rounding.
3.  **Data Ingest Endpoints**: Secure backend endpoints (, , , ) were implemented to receive form data, store it locally, and forward it to an external Admin Dashboard.
4.  **Contact Sales Form UI Enhancement**: Added Monthly Call Volume and Monthly Interaction Volume fields, along with an administrative page for managing these requests.
5.  **Branding Consistency**: Removed Made with Emergent branding elements.
6.  **Customer Journey Modals**: Required fixing modal positioning (initially appearing at the bottom), improving transition smoothness, matching modal colors to cards, removing scrollbars, and finally enhancing content with step-by-step guides.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving critical UI/UX issues for the **Customer Journey interactive modals**. The user reported that despite previous fixes, the modal still appeared slightly below the viewport (requiring scrolling), was laggy, had an ugly scrollbar, and its color grading did not match the corresponding cards.

The AI engineer systematically addressed these issues in :
1.  **Modal Positioning**: Re-implemented positioning logic to calculate the modal's  and  coordinates based on the clicked card's position using  and /. This aimed to make the modal appear directly *above* the clicked card.
2.  **Scrollbar Removal**: Simplified modal content to be more compact and removed any overflow that would necessitate a scrollbar within the modal itself.
3.  **Performance & Transitions**: Implicitly improved by simplifying the modal's rendering, ensuring smooth appearance.
4.  **Color Matching**: Identified the specific color for each journey stage (e.g.,  for Contact,  for Triage) and applied these colors dynamically to the modal's header, key metrics, and other content sections.
5.  **Content Enhancement**: Significantly expanded the modal content for each stage to include comprehensive step-by-step information about the SentraTech process, making the modals slightly bigger to accommodate this detail, and added a Next Stage navigation hint.

The trajectory concludes with the AI engineer having applied these changes and is now preparing to **test the enhanced modal with comprehensive information**, aiming to verify the new size, content, positioning, and overall user experience.
