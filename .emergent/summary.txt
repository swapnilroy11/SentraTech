The AI engineer's work spanned several crucial areas: refining Customer Journey modals for smooth scrolling and dynamic styling, enhancing the Contact Sales page with a Today filter button, and comprehensively building out the Careers section. A significant portion involved designing, processing, and integrating professional team photos into the Leadership Team page with flexible layouts. Critical attention was also given to resolving data ingestion failures, first by fixing a hardcoded API key, then by implementing a robust backend proxy solution for external dashboard forwarding, and finally by establishing a comprehensive protection system for this configuration. The most recent focus has been on developing an industry-standard, multi-step Careers application page, transitioning from a modal to a dedicated page, updating salary details, and initiating fixes for layout and content overflow.

The SentraTech application aims to be an AI + BI customer support platform with a high-conversion dark theme. Core requirements included repositioning the Sentra AI button and updating AI training, ensuring bulletproof mathematical accuracy and UI redesign for the ROI Calculator, and implementing secure data ingest endpoints (, , etc.) to store locally and forward to an external Admin Dashboard. The Contact Sales form needed UI enhancements (volume fields, admin page). Branding consistency required removing Made with Emergent elements. Customer Journey Modals necessitated fixes for positioning, smooth transitions, color matching, and content. Subsequent requests involved enhancing modal scrollbar design, adding a Today button to the time filtering on the Contact Sales page, and creating professional team photos for the Leadership Team page with specific layout and content. Most recently, a comprehensive Careers page with a full, multi-step job application form (CV upload, LinkedIn, Supabase integration, Slack/email notifications) was requested, requiring a transition from a modal to a dedicated, industry-standard page, Competitive salary display, and refined job description content.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on further enhancements to the Careers page and the newly created . The user reported that text was overflowing card boundaries on the careers page, the View Details button was not functioning as expected, and requested a more comprehensive and engaging job details section within the application flow. The Apply for open position button at the bottom of the careers page also needed to direct to the new dedicated application page.
