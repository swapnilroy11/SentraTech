The trajectory details a comprehensive development and debugging process, starting with the creation of a robust FastAPI proxy () to handle form submissions. This initial phase involved fixing backend configuration errors and implementing features like idempotency, retries, and logging.

A recurring and central theme is the discrepancy between the AI's development environment (a preview server) and the user's production environment ( at IP ). The AI repeatedly completes tasks on the preview server, which are then packaged for deployment, as the user reports the changes are not live.

The work then pivoted to a series of frontend fixes based on user requests. This included performance optimization of the ROI calculator page by replacing heavy JavaScript animations (Framer Motion) with CSS transitions, extensive UI/UX adjustments (updating the Investor Relations page, fixing the cookie modal, removing/restoring UI elements like hamburger menus and icons), and resolving data logic issues in the contact sales form.

The final and most critical task was investigating why job applications were being lost. While the user suspected a wrong API endpoint, deep testing revealed the backend API was fully functional. The root cause was identified as a critical frontend bug: the Submit Application button was completely non-functional, lacking any event handlers and thus never making a network request. The work concluded immediately after this discovery.

The core requirement is to ensure the  website is fully functional, performant, and bug-free on its production server (IP: ).

Initial requirements focused on building a reliable backend proxy at  for all form submissions, forwarding them to an admin dashboard. This proxy needed idempotency, retries, persistence, and detailed logging.

Subsequent requirements shifted to the frontend, demanding fixes for:
1.  **Performance:** Resolve laggy scrolling and slow transition effects on pages like the ROI Calculator.
2.  **UI/UX:**
    *   Update content on the Investor Relations page (funding goal, timeline).
    *   Remove specific UI elements: a search icon, a floating admin button, and a floating blue hamburger menu, while preserving the main navigation menu.
    *   Correct visual bugs, such as font overlapping on job application cards and broken hover effects on homepage cards.
    *   Update social media icons in the footer (Twitter to X, add Facebook).
3.  **Functionality:**
    *   Ensure the cookie modal appears instantly and only once.
    *   Fix the contact sales form to populate correct volume data when a range is selected.
    *   **Critically:** Resolve the issue of lost job applications by ensuring the form submits data correctly to the dashboard.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **FastAPI:** Used for the Python backend, including the form submission proxy.
- **React:** The core framework for the frontend application.
- **Framer Motion:** JavaScript animation library identified as a source of performance issues.
- **CSS Animations/Transitions:** Used to replace Framer Motion for better performance.
- **Deployment Workflow:** A key concept was the distinction between the preview server (for development) and the production server, requiring the creation of deployment packages () for handoff.

<code_architecture>
The application is a monorepo with a distinct frontend and backend. The primary work occurred within  and .



-   ****: The main FastAPI application file. It was initially modified to implement the  proxy and later inspected to verify that all form submission endpoints () were correctly defined and functional.

-   ** & **: These files were heavily modified to improve performance by removing expensive Framer Motion  animations and replacing them with CSS-based transitions.

-   ****: Edited to update text content related to funding goals and timelines, and to remove two of three CTA buttons.

-   ****: Modified multiple times: first to mistakenly remove the main hamburger menu, then to restore it, and finally to remove the search icon.

-   ****: Edited to replace the Twitter icon with a custom X icon and add a new Facebook social media link.

-   ****: The logic for populating call and interaction volume fields was updated to ensure the total volume correctly reflects the selected range button.

-   ** & **: The CSS classes in these files were adjusted to fix font overlapping issues on the job cards. The modal component was identified as having a non-functional submit button.

-   ****: This file was analyzed to confirm that frontend form submission functions were pointing to the correct backend proxy endpoints. It was temporarily modified during debugging but ultimately reverted to its correct state.

-   ****: New CSS classes for performant animations and card hover effects were added to this global stylesheet.

<pending_tasks>
- **Fix the Job Application Form:** The critical pending task is to fix the non-functional Submit Application button in the  component. This involves adding the correct  event handler to trigger the  function.
- **Deploy All Fixes to Production:** Once the job application form is fixed, all accumulated changes (UI fixes, performance optimizations, bug fixes) must be packaged and deployed to the correct production server at IP .
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate last action was a comprehensive investigation into why job applications submitted from the website were being lost. The user suspected that the form was sending data to the wrong API endpoint.

However, a series of diagnostic tests revealed a different and more critical root cause:
1.  **Backend Verification:** Backend testing confirmed that the job application API endpoint () on the production server is fully operational and correctly processes incoming data.
2.  **Frontend Testing:** A detailed frontend test was conducted on the live job application page (). This test uncovered that the **Submit Application button is completely broken**. It lacks any associated JavaScript event handlers (, ).

**Conclusion:** When a user clicks the submit button, absolutely nothing happensâ€”no network request is made, and the form data is never sent to any endpoint. This 100% data loss is due to a non-functional frontend component, not a backend or configuration issue. The work stopped immediately after confirming this critical frontend bug.

I will now fix the broken Submit Application button in the  component by implementing the necessary event handler to ensure it correctly submits the form data.
