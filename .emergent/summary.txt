The AI engineer's work in this trajectory primarily focused on refining core application features, fixing critical calculation logic, implementing new data ingestion pipelines, and ensuring a polished user interface. Key tasks included debugging and re-integrating the chat widget, redesigning and rigorously correcting the ROI Calculator's mathematical logic multiple times with a bulletproof implementation, and setting up robust backend ingest endpoints for various forms (demo requests, contact sales, ROI reports, newsletter subscriptions). UI enhancements were also made to the Contact Sales form and a new management page for contact requests was created. The removal of the Made with Emergent logo across the application further streamlined branding. The work demonstrates iterative refinement, with a strong emphasis on precision, robust error handling, and future-proofing, especially for complex calculations.

The SentraTech application, an AI + BI customer support platform, aims for high conversion with a dark theme. Recent development focused on:

1.  **Chat Functionality**: Removing redundant chat widgets, restoring and repositioning the Sentra AI button to the bottom-left, and training the AI with comprehensive business information (including updated pricing, website navigation, contact info, and ROI details).
2.  **ROI Calculator Redesign & Accuracy**: A complete UI redesign (single-column, real-time calculations, glassmorphism design, country-specific costs). Crucially, the calculation logic required multiple fixes: correcting bundle calculation (1 bundle per 1000 calls *and* 1000 interactions), setting bundle cost to ,200 (then ,650) with proportional allocation (61.5% calls, 38.5% interactions), using distinct AHT for calls (8 min) and interactions (5 min), and finally implementing a bulletproof mathematical engine with precise rounding and validation to prevent future errors. UI alignment of input fields was also addressed.
3.  **Data Ingest Endpoints**: Implementing secure backend endpoints (, , , ) to receive form submissions, validate , store locally, and forward to an external admin dashboard.
4.  **Contact Sales Form UI Enhancement**: Adding Monthly Call Volume and Monthly Interaction Volume fields with quick-select options, and creating a new administrative Contact Sales Management page with filtering and CSV export.
5.  **Branding Consistency**: Removing the Made with Emergent logo and updating the page title.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with a deep investigation and permanent fix for recurring mathematical accuracy issues in the **ROI Calculator**. This involved:

1.  **Deep Investigation**: Tracing through the calculation system, constants, and previous fixes.
2.  **Bulletproof Implementation**: Creating a new, robust  component to entirely replace previous ROI calculation logic. This new implementation features:
    *   **Immutable Constants**: Using  on all calculation constants (, , ) to prevent accidental modification.
    *   **Protected Calculation Engine**: Encapsulating the core calculation logic within a class () with validated methods.
    *   **Strict Validation**: Implementing rigorous input and output validation within the engine to ensure data integrity at every step.
    *   **Integrated Test Suite**: Running comprehensive test cases (from ) automatically on component mount in development mode to catch any deviations immediately.
    *   **Precise Formatting**: Ensuring all currency and percentage values are formatted with exact precision to avoid rounding discrepancies seen previously (e.g., ,550 displaying as .5K instead of .6K).
3.  **UI Verification**: Testing the updated ROI Calculator with specific inputs (e.g., 1000 calls, 1000 interactions, Bangladesh /bin/bash.40/min, ,650 bundle price) to verify that all metrics (Traditional BPO, SentraTech AI, Savings, ROI%, Cost Reduction%, Bundles) matched the mathematically expected values precisely.

The ROI Calculator's mathematical precision is now considered **bulletproof**, with all identified calculation and formatting errors resolved, and robust protection against future issues implemented.
