The AI engineer's work involved a comprehensive series of UI/UX and functional enhancements for the SentraTech application. Initial efforts focused on redesigning the Contact Sales slide-in panel for the pricing page, addressing Supabase integration failures, and resolving critical positioning issues by implementing a fixed, right-side slide-over drawer with robust accessibility features. Concurrently, pricing card buttons were streamlined, and the hamburger menu's transparency on mobile/tablet was fixed, followed by resolving a complex overlap where clicking Contact Sales opened the navigation menu instead. Significant work was also done on the ROI Calculator, including a complete revamp of the pricing toggle to 24/36 Months with a 10% discount, optimizing FAQ dropdown animations, and resolving a major performance issue causing the ROI Calculator page to load blank. Further enhancements included adding animated 3D flags to country selection cards, implementing manual call volume adjustment, and meticulously refining the ROI calculation logic to handle negative savings as Cost Increase. The most recent activity centers on addressing persistent lag in homepage navigation buttons linked to specific sections.

The SentraTech app is a high-conversion, dark-themed AI + BI customer support platform featuring a sleek UI with Matrix Green accents, glass-morphism, Rajdhani font, particle cursor, and rich animations. It integrates CRM forms (Supabase), LLM chat, and dynamic KPI counters. The ROI Calculator, now a multi-country tool (Bangladesh, India, Philippines, Vietnam) with market-research-backed baselines, saves detailed reports to Supabase.

Recent work included:
1.  **Contact Sales Panel Revamp**: Replace the existing popup to top behavior with an inline, right-side slide-over drawer (320px wide on desktop, full-width on mobile), ensuring , focus trap, ESC close, and ARIA attributes. It also included cleaning up Start Free Trial from Starter, Request Demo from Growth, and duplicate Contact Sales from Enterprise cards, while standardizing matrix-green CTA styling. The form layout, submission UX (inline spinner, success state), and secondary actions were also specified.
2.  **Pricing Toggle**: Replace Monthly/Yearly with 24 months / 36 months options, applying a 10% discount for 36-month contracts.
3.  **FAQ Animations**: Fix laggy dropdown transitions for a smooth effect.
4.  **ROI Calculator Page Load**: Resolve slow loading/blank page issue for the Calculate Your Savings section.
5.  **3D Flags**: Add animated 3D flag pictures next to country names, replacing country initials, on ROI calculator cards.
6.  **Manual Call Volume**: Add a manual Call Volume adjustment card similar to Agent Count, keeping automatic calculation logic intact, with auto/manual toggle.
7.  **ROI Logic Refinement**: Ensure ROI and Cost Reduction are dynamic, not fixed. Specifically, adjust language to Cost Increase for negative savings, with corresponding visual and logical updates.
8.  **Input Field Flexibility**: Allow free manual typing in Agent Count and AHT fields, removing restrictive minimums (e.g., allow 0, 1), and implement validation warnings for out-of-range values.
9.  **Leading Zero Removal**: Eliminate leading zeros (e.g., 01 instead of 1) in calculator input fields.
10. **Homepage Navigation Smoothness**: Fix laggy transitions for hash-scrolling buttons (Multi-Channel Support, Customer Journey, 70% Automation, Real-time Metrics, Enterprise Security).

<code_architecture>

- ****: This component was entirely revamped to implement the detailed slide-over panel, including form fields, Supabase submission, accessibility features, and responsiveness. Its  was significantly increased to  to resolve layering conflicts with other UI elements like the hamburger menu.
- ****: Modified to remove unwanted CTA buttons (Start Free Trial, Request Demo, duplicate Contact Sales) from pricing cards and to trigger the new  component. It also contains the pricing toggle logic.
- ****: Updated to fix Supabase table name and constraint value mismatches, ensuring successful form submissions to the  table.
- ****: Edited to update  data, specifically removing the unwanted CTAs from the pricing cards.
- ****: The hamburger menu's transparency was fixed by adjusting its  opacity, and the mobile menu panel's background and borders were made more opaque for better visibility. Logic was added to ensure the hamburger menu is suppressed when the Contact Sales panel is open.
- ****: The FAQ section within this page was updated. Laggy dropdown animations were fixed by replacing  with  transforms using Framer Motion's  for smooth transitions.
- ****: Performance issues leading to a blank page on initial load were resolved by removing  animations that wrapped the  component, ensuring instant rendering. It also contains hardcoded marketing statistics that were a source of confusion.
- ****: This central component underwent extensive modifications.
    -   Its initial rendering  animations were replaced with  for immediate loading.
    -   It now supports a pricing toggle (24 months / 36 months) with a 10% discount logic.
    -   Country selection cards were enhanced with animated 3D flag emojis, replacing plain initials.
    -   A manual call volume adjustment card was added, transitioning the layout to three columns and making existing cards smaller.
    -   Input fields (Agent Count, AHT) were made fully editable, removing restrictive  attributes and implementing validation warnings instead of blocking input.
    -   The leading zero issue in input fields was resolved by refining input value handling.
    -   The UI for ROI and Cost Reduction was updated to dynamically display Cost Increase and Loss with red styling and correct directional arrows when savings are negative.
-   ****: The core ROI calculation logic was fundamentally corrected. Traditional BPO costs now scale dynamically with , while SentraTech AI costs remain fixed per . New flags (, ) were introduced to handle negative savings scenarios.
-   ****: Contains the  data with flag emojis and per-country cost baselines used by the ROI Calculator.
-   ****: Custom  animation was added here for the 3D flag effects.
-   ****: This custom hook is currently suspected to be the cause of laggy hash navigation on the homepage buttons. It contains multiple timeouts, heavy logging, and complex retry logic.

- Complete synchronized-style particle cursor trail.
- Ensure all six case study cards have uniform hover effects.
- Implement lazy-loading and critical CSS inlining.
- Re-enable and debug the service worker registration.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with resolving the laggy and non-smooth transitions observed when clicking homepage navigation buttons such as Multi-Channel Support, Customer Journey, 70% Automation, Real-time Metrics, and Enterprise Security. The user explicitly noted that the ROI Calculator button was smooth, implying a specific issue with hash-scrolling navigation.

The AI engineer identified that these problematic buttons in  are utilizing a custom hook named . Upon inspecting , the AI engineer pinpointed several potential performance bottlenecks:
1.  **Multiple timeout delays**: The hook uses  multiple times (300ms initial, plus up to 5 retries with 200ms each), which can accumulate and cause noticeable delays.
2.  **Heavy console logging**: Extensive logging within the hook on every navigation could contribute to performance overhead.
3.  **Complex retry logic**: The retry mechanism, while intended for robustness, might be too aggressive or inefficient, potentially leading to UI freezing during navigation attempts.
4.  **State management overhead**: Unnecessary state updates and re-renders within the hook could be impacting performance.

The AI engineer's last action was to identify these performance issues within the  hook and was about to proceed with fixing them to ensure smooth hash-scrolling for the specified homepage buttons.
