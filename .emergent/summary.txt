The previous AI engineer meticulously refined the SentraTech application, primarily focusing on two core areas: iterative enhancement of the pricing page UI and critical debugging/integration of contact forms with Supabase. The pricing page underwent multiple rounds of adjustments, starting from filling empty space, then compressing cards to fit a single screen, reverting to a beautiful design with specific content removal, and finally standardizing green color themes and simplifying value propositions. Concurrently, significant effort was dedicated to fixing persistent submission issues for both Contact Sales and Demo Request forms, which involved extensive Supabase schema debugging, table name corrections, column mapping, and integrating new fields like Monthly Interaction Volume. The work demonstrated an iterative approach to UI/UX and a systematic, though challenging, resolution of data persistence issues.

<product_requirements>
The SentraTech application aims to be a high-conversion AI + BI customer support platform with a dark theme. Initial requirements included UI/UX improvements like accessible Contact Sales slide-in, streamlined pricing CTAs, and a refined ROI Calculator with 24/36-month pricing and country-specific baselines.

Major recent feature additions included:
1.  **New Pricing UI:** A 3-tier pricing model (Starter, Growth, Enterprise) with a 24/36-month toggle, dynamic pricing, matrix green styling, and a Most Popular ribbon. CTAs must prefill Contact Sales data and trigger analytics/Supabase events. The UI has been iterated multiple times to be compact, professional, industry-standard, and visually consistent with the main site's matrix green theme, removing verbose elements and standardizing content. The Enterprise card was converted to a Custom plan with dynamic features.
2.  **Per-1,000 Bundle ROI Calculator:** Initially developed with a new UI, but later integrated into the original  using per 1,000 calls + 1,000 interactions bundles, Call Volume Mode, Agent Count Mode, Per-Bundle Mode, and country-specific baselines (Philippines, India, Bangladesh, Vietnam).
3.  **Form Functionality & Supabase Integration:** Ensure Contact Sales and Demo Request forms work reliably. This included adding Monthly Interaction Volume to the Demo Request form, fixing submission errors, ensuring proper UI confirmation, and aligning frontend data fields with the backend Supabase schema, including creating/updating necessary SQL tables and policies. The Schedule Demo option was also removed from the Contact Sales form.

-   **Full-stack**: React, FastAPI, MongoDB, Supabase (PostgreSQL backend).
-   **Frontend**: Tailwind CSS for styling, React for UI,  for navigation, Framer Motion for animations,  from , CSS Grid/Flexbox for layout.
-   **Backend**: FastAPI for API endpoints, Supabase for data persistence.
-   **Data Persistence**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) schema management, Row Level Security (RLS), and indexing.

<code_architecture>

-   ****: Central component for pricing card display. This file underwent extensive modifications to implement multiple UI iterations for 3-tier pricing, toggle functionality, dynamic content, responsiveness, and visual styling, including content trimming, font adjustments, button alignment, and matrix green color synchronization.
-   ****: Handles the slide-over contact form. Modified to integrate with pricing card selections, remove the Schedule Demo option and its associated logic/validation, and adjust form fields to match Supabase schema requirements.
-   ****: Contains the Demo Request form. Modified to include Monthly Interaction Volume and Monthly Call Volume fields, adapting form state and UI to match Supabase schema changes.
-   ****: Renders the Demo Request form. Used indirectly via .
-   ****: Manages Supabase interactions. Critical for handling Contact Sales and Demo Request submissions. Modified numerous times to correct table names (, , ), column mappings ( vs ), and to include/exclude specific fields (, , , , , , ) based on evolving database schemas and debugging.
-   ****: (NEW) Initially provided a template for Supabase setup. This file and similar ad-hoc SQL scripts (e.g., , ) were crucial for defining the Supabase schema, including table creation, column additions, indexing, RLS policies, and permissions for  and  tables.
-   ****: The FastAPI backend. Its  endpoint was confirmed to handle plan metadata after Supabase insertions, indicating backend support for form submissions.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully finalized the integration of the Demo Request form with a specific Supabase schema provided by the user. This involved ensuring that the frontend's  and  correctly map form fields like , , , , , , and  to the corresponding columns in the  Supabase table.

The process included:
1.  **Updating Frontend Fields**: Re-adding Monthly Call Volume and Monthly Interaction Volume input fields to the Demo Request form in , ensuring they were visually organized and integrated into the existing UI without altering the overall design.
2.  **Schema Alignment**: Modifying  to correctly send data to the  table, specifically addressing the column name change from  to  (snake_case).
3.  **Extensive Testing**: Performing comprehensive backend and frontend tests to confirm that form submissions successfully create records in Supabase, that all fields are stored correctly, and that no schema cache errors or submission failures occur.

The latest communication confirms the updated Supabase schema is working perfectly with 100% success rate, indicating that the Demo Request form is fully functional and correctly integrated with the user's specified database structure.
