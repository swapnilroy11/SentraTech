The trajectory details the AI engineer's work on the SentraTech application, covering three main phases: fixing backend data integrations, mobile optimization, and a broad site performance overhaul. Initially, the AI addressed Airtable integration issues by completely removing the service and related code. Following this, significant effort was invested in improving mobile and tablet UX based on user-provided screenshots, which included layout, spacing, typography, and navigation enhancements. Subsequently, the AI debugged and fixed various form submission issues, specifically for the ROI calculator and Job Applications, involving data type conversions and field mapping. A major attempt at Google Sheets integration for job applications was made but ultimately reverted due to configuration complexities and user preference. The final, extensive phase involved optimizing the entire site for smoothness and responsiveness, leading to the introduction of critical CSS, Web Workers, lazy loading, and modern image formats. This phase, however, concluded with persistent blank page errors due to React rendering issues and JavaScript errors, which the AI was actively debugging.

<product_requirements>
The overarching goal is to ensure the SentraTech website is fully functional, performant, and user-friendly across all devices. This began with resolving a critical Kaniko build error blocking deployments. Subsequent requirements included:

1.  **Backend Data Integration Fixes:**
    *   Completely remove Airtable integration due to .
    *   Ensure ROI calculator data successfully transfers to the dashboard, fixing specific validation errors (e.g.,  field type mismatch).
    *   Verify newsletter data transfers correctly (found to be working).
    *   Fix Job Applications data transfer to the dashboard, addressing field mapping and data type validation issues (e.g., ,  arrays vs. strings).
    *   Update Job Application form fields and submission format to a new specification.
    *   Integrate Google Sheets for job applications alongside the existing dashboard submission, then later remove it due to user's issues.

2.  **Mobile and Tablet UX Optimization:**
    *   Resolve visual glitches and unorganized layouts on mobile/tablet as depicted in provided screenshots.
    *   Optimize footer layout, social media icons, hero section, button sizing, and quick stats for responsiveness.
    *   Enhance typography, readability, and the copyright section for mobile.
    *   Ensure mobile navigation (hamburger menu) functions correctly and looks professional.

3.  **Site Performance and Responsiveness Optimization:**
    *   Optimize the entire site for maximum smoothness and responsiveness across desktop, tablet, and mobile.
    *   Implement critical CSS inlining, defer non-essential scripts, use modern image formats (AVIF/WebP) with lazy loading, offload heavy computations to Web Workers, utilize GPU-accelerated CSS transforms, and configure preconnect/prefetch strategies.
    *   Address responsive layout shifts, simplify complex scroll effects, and use passive event listeners for mobile.
    *   Ensure instant first-visit performance, immediate route transitions, and 60 FPS animations. This phase led to a critical blank page issue that needs resolving.

<pending_tasks>
-   Monitor the build logs of the most recent deployment to confirm the  error is resolved. (Already addressed by previous AI's summary, but still a verification step).
-   Perform smoke tests on the preview URL. (Partially done with screenshots, needs more explicit  tests).
-   Remove temporary  debugging lines from . (Not explicitly mentioned as done).
-   Fix the blank page issue currently observed on the frontend preview.
-   Address Cannot access handleScroll before initialization, motion is not defined, and React JSX attribute warnings in .
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in an extensive effort to optimize the entire site for maximum smoothness and responsiveness, as explicitly requested by the user. This involved implementing a wide range of performance enhancements across the frontend, including:

-   **Critical CSS and Resource Loading:** Modifying  and  for optimized loading.
-   **Web Workers:** Introducing  and integrating it into  to offload heavy computations.
-   **Lazy Loading and IntersectionObserver:** Creating  to manage these.
-   **Optimized Images:** Creating  for modern image formats and lazy loading.
-   **GPU-Accelerated Animations:** Applying these to components like  and .

During this optimization phase, the frontend started displaying a blank page. The AI engineer has been actively debugging this critical rendering issue. The compilation logs are now clean, but the browser console reveals new JavaScript errors:

1.  ****: Indicates an ordering problem with function definition and usage.
2.  ****: Suggests an issue with  imports or scope.
3.  **React JSX attribute warnings** related to a  component.

The AI's last action was acknowledging these specific errors and planning to fix them to restore the site's functionality. The core problem is that despite successful compilation, the React application is not rendering its content due to these runtime JavaScript errors, resulting in a blank preview page.
