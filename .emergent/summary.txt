The trajectory details the debugging of a critical, deployment-blocking build error in the SentraTech web application. The previous work involved numerous UI and content updates, primarily on the , and security cleanups like removing admin routes. However, all these changes were stuck due to a .

Following a detailed diagnostic plan from a troubleshooter agent, the AI engineer began a methodical investigation. Initial analysis incorrectly pointed to a duplicate import within a single file. However, a deeper search revealed the true root cause: the existence of a complete duplicate frontend application directory at , which conflicted with the correct source directory at . The build system was inadvertently including both, leading to the identifier collision in the  file.

The engineer resolved this by renaming the entire  directory to , effectively excluding it from the build process. A subsequent yarn run v1.22.22

The final action was to verify the application's state before proceeding with the production deployment of all accumulated changes. The core task transitioned from feature development to critical build-failure diagnostics and resolution.

<product_requirements>
The primary objective is to finalize and deploy a series of updates to the SentraTech website. This involves resolving a critical build failure that prevents any changes from going live.

**Key Requirements Implemented (but not yet deployed):**
1.  **UI/UX Improvements:**
    *   Fix the newsletter subscription form to remove duplicate success messages and show a simple tick on the button.
    *   Update footer social media icons (Twitter to 'X', add Facebook).
    *   Clean up the main navigation by removing admin/search buttons and improving link spacing.
2.  **Investor Relations Page Overhaul:**
    *   Update timeline dates (e.g., to 2026/2027) and funding goals (to 0k).
    *   Completely replace the Founding Team section with new members, photos, and a 2x2 grid layout.
    *   Apply specific styling: matrix green titles, increased font sizes, bold text, and black-and-white filters for team photos.
3.  **Security Hardening:**
    *   Remove all public-facing Admin buttons and links.
    *   Delete the  route to prevent direct URL access.

**Blocking Requirement (Now Resolved):**
*   Fix the deployment-blocking  to enable a successful production build.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **React:** The frontend is built using the React library.
- **TailwindCSS:** Used for all styling and layout modifications.
- **CRACO (Create React App Configuration Override):** Used to customize the webpack build process.
- **Yarn:** The designated package manager for the frontend project.
- **Monorepo Structure:** The project uses a monorepo with distinct packages for different parts of the application (e.g., ).
- **Emergent Platform:** The application is deployed via a platform that uses  for build and deployment instructions.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is structured as a monorepo, with the primary frontend code located in . A critical issue was discovered where a duplicate, legacy directory  existed, causing build conflicts. This duplicate has been renamed to .

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files:**
-   ** (Directory)**
    -   **Importance:** This directory was an unintended, duplicate copy of the frontend codebase. Its presence was the root cause of the deployment-blocking build failure.
    -   **Changes:** The entire directory was renamed to  to remove it from the build path and resolve the  identifier conflict. This was the most critical action taken.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This file provides the  hook and was the epicenter of the build error. The build system was finding two declarations of  because this file existed in both the  and  directories.
    -   **Changes:** No code was changed in this file. The issue was resolved by removing the duplicate file's directory.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This file defines the build and deployment configuration. It was inspected to confirm that the build process was correctly targeting the  directory.
    -   **Changes:** A previous change had already corrected the build command from npm <command>

Usage:

npm install        install all the dependencies in your project
npm install <foo>  add the <foo> dependency to your project
npm test           run this project's tests
npm run <foo>      run the script named <foo>
npm <command> -h   quick help on <command>
npm -l             display usage info for all commands
npm help <term>    search for help on <term>
npm help npm       more involved overview

Done in 0.12s., which was essential for correct dependency handling.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This file contains the content and layout for the investor relations section and was the target of most of the feature update requests.
    -   **Changes:** The file was heavily modified with updated text, a new data structure for team members, a new 2x2 grid layout for the team section, and numerous TailwindCSS class changes for styling. These changes are awaiting deployment.

<pending_tasks>
- Deploy all the accumulated UI, content, and security changes to the production environment () now that the build is fixed.
- Verify that all the deployed changes appear correctly on the live website.

<current_work>
The immediate past work was focused exclusively on debugging a critical build failure that prevented deployment. The error, , was traced back to the presence of a duplicate frontend codebase in the  directory, which conflicted with the correct source code in .

The issue was resolved by renaming the conflicting directory:


Following this action, a local production build was executed successfully using the command:
yarn run v1.22.22
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command.

The build completed without errors, confirming that the duplicate identifier issue is resolved. The project is now in a state where it can be deployed. The last step the previous engineer was about to take was to capture a screenshot to visually verify the application's state before initiating the final deployment to production.

<optional_next_step>
Deploy the successful build to production to release all pending feature updates and fixes.
