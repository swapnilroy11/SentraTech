The trajectory chronicles a complex debugging and development journey, pivoting from fixing an existing form submission proxy to architecting and implementing a new, more robust one. The initial work focused on resolving Internal Server Error issues in a Python FastAPI backend, which were traced back to misconfigured environment variables (a duplicated URL path segment) and hardcoded URLs causing partial deployment failures.

The user then introduced a major new requirement: a reliable, same-origin proxy () with advanced features like idempotency, retries, logging, and fallback persistence. An initial implementation was built as a separate Node.js service managed by PM2. However, this was later refactored directly into the existing FastAPI backend () to simplify the architecture and remove the intermediate service.

This refactoring led to further debugging around authentication headers, where the dashboard required a legacy  while the user specified the standard . The final solution was to send *both* headers for a seamless transition. The trajectory concludes with a prolonged effort to deploy this solution to production, uncovering a critical misunderstanding: the AI was working on a preview server, while the production domain pointed to a different server. The final agreed-upon task is to package the completed work for deployment on the correct production machine.

<product_requirements>
The primary objective is to create a reliable, secure, and robust same-origin proxy for all form submissions from the  website. This proxy, accessible at the  endpoint, must intercept frontend form data and forward it directly to the production dashboard at .

The proxy must be implemented within the existing FastAPI backend to maintain a simple architecture. Key features required are:
1.  **Idempotency**: Use a  to prevent duplicate submissions within a 24-hour window.
2.  **Retry Logic**: On upstream failures (5xx errors or timeouts), retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff.
3.  **Persistence**: If all retries fail, persist the submission payload to a local directory () for manual replay.
4.  **Payload Enrichment**: Add metadata to each submission, including , , and .
5.  **Comprehensive Logging**: Log every request, upstream response, and error to  in a structured JSON format.
6.  **Secure Authentication**: Forward requests using the  from environment variables, sending both  and  headers to ensure a smooth transition.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **FastAPI Proxy**: The core backend technology used to implement the final  endpoint, handling all business logic.
- **Idempotency**: Preventing duplicate processing using a unique  and an in-memory deduplication store.
- **Retry with Exponential Backoff**: A resilience pattern to handle transient network or upstream service failures.
- **Dual Authentication Headers**: Sending both  and  to maintain compatibility with the dashboard during its transition to standard authentication.
- **Nginx & Let's Encrypt**: Used for production deployment, reverse proxying, and SSL/TLS certificate management.
</key_technical_concepts>
<code_architecture>
The application follows a monorepo structure, but the core work centered on the Python backend and its production deployment configuration.



-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This is the heart of the application. It's the FastAPI server that was initially debugged and then heavily modified to house the new, robust  proxy endpoint.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: The initial proxy logic was flawed with hardcoded URLs and incorrect endpoint construction. This was entirely replaced with a new  route that implements all product requirements: direct dashboard forwarding, payload enrichment, idempotency checks, a retry mechanism with exponential backoff, logging, and fallback persistence to the filesystem. Crucially, it was updated to send dual authentication headers ( and ) and the correct  header to resolve authentication and CORS issues with the dashboard.

-   ** and **
    -   **Importance**: These files represent an intermediate, now-deprecated implementation of the proxy as a standalone Node.js service managed by PM2.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: These files were created from scratch based on the user's initial detailed specification. However, this two-hop architecture (Frontend -> FastAPI -> Node.js Proxy -> Dashboard) was deemed too complex. The user requested to simplify, leading to the logic being ported to  and this entire service being shut down and deleted via PM2.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Stores critical configuration for the backend, including the dashboard URL and API key.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: This file was edited to correct the  by removing a redundant  path segment, which was the root cause of the initial 405 Method Not Allowed errors.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: The Nginx configuration file responsible for routing production traffic for , handling SSL termination, and proxying requests to the backend service.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: A production-ready configuration was created. It handles HTTP to HTTPS redirection, specifies paths for Let's Encrypt SSL certificates, and contains a  block to correctly proxy pass requests to the local proxy service running on its designated port (e.g., 3003).

<pending_tasks>
- **Deploy to Production Server**: The primary pending task is to deploy the finalized FastAPI proxy service and Nginx configuration onto the correct production server located at IP .
- **Dashboard Authentication Update**: The dashboard team needs to be prompted to update their service to accept  tokens, allowing for the eventual deprecation of the legacy  header.
- **Install Let's Encrypt on Production**: Once deployed on the correct server, run  to install a valid SSL certificate.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed the development and testing of a robust, same-origin proxy within the FastAPI backend. All the required features—idempotency, retries, logging, payload enrichment, and dual authentication headers—have been implemented in . The proxy has been thoroughly tested in the preview environment and is confirmed to be working correctly, successfully forwarding form submissions to the production dashboard.

The most recent and critical development was the realization that all this work was performed on a **preview server ()**, while the actual production domain () points to a different **production server ()**. The user has confirmed this discrepancy and has explicitly requested that the AI proceed with Option 1, which is to deploy the completed solution onto the correct production server.

Therefore, the immediate task at hand is to prepare a complete deployment package containing all necessary code, configuration files (for Nginx, PM2/service management), and step-by-step instructions for setting up the environment and launching the service on the production server at . The code itself is considered complete and production-ready; it just needs to be moved to the right machine.
