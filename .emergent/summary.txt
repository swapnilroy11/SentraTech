The trajectory documents a multi-stage development process, beginning with a user request to refactor a multi-step job application form into a single, streamlined page. This initial task involved significant frontend modifications in  but was complicated by environment issues, specifically an outdated Supervisor configuration pointing to a legacy directory structure ( instead of ).

Following this, the project pivoted to a major integration effort: decoupling a legacy dashboard and preparing for a new, enterprise-grade one. This involved systematically disabling proxy endpoints, WebSocket connections, and frontend links. The AI engineer then generated detailed payload schemas and a comprehensive integration specification for the new dashboard team, covering API endpoints, database schemas, and CORS configurations for production domains ( and ).

The final, most complex phase was the live integration and subsequent deep debugging. Despite the backend proxy returning success messages, no data was reaching the new dashboard. This led to a meticulous investigation that uncovered a series of critical configuration mismatches between the website and dashboard environments (URLs, API keys). The ultimate root cause was identified as graceful degradation logic in the website's backend proxy, which was masking validation errors () from the dashboard and returning false positives. After correcting payloads and fixing hardcoded URLs in the deployed backend, the integration was successfully established, and live test data was sent across all five form types.

<product_requirements>
The primary objective is to build and maintain the SentraTech application, comprising a public-facing website () and a secure administrative dashboard ().

**Core Requirements:**
1.  **Unified Monorepo:** Consolidate the website and dashboard into a single  directory.
2.  **Secure Data Proxy:** All form submissions (Newsletter, ROI Calculator, Demo Request, Contact Sales, Job Application) must be routed through a secure FastAPI backend proxy. This proxy is responsible for forwarding data to the live dashboard.
3.  **Enterprise Admin Dashboard:** A new, live dashboard that receives and displays form submissions in real-time. The integration must be robust, handling cross-domain communication and authentication securely.
4.  **Streamlined User Experience:** The job application process must be a single, continuous form on one page, eliminating the previous four-step journey to improve usability.
5.  **Production Readiness:** The entire application must be environment-aware, using configuration variables instead of hardcoded values to ensure seamless deployment and communication between the website and the live dashboard servers.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Monorepo Architecture**: Manages frontend (, ) and  projects in a unified structure under .
- **FastAPI Backend**: Acts as a secure proxy, forwarding form submissions from the website to the external dashboard API and handling graceful fallbacks.
- **React & Tailwind CSS**: Used for building the responsive user interfaces for the public-facing website.
- **Supervisor**: Manages the lifecycle of backend and frontend services, ensuring they are running correctly.
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: Critical for enabling communication between the website () and the dashboard API ().
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a monorepo structure with separate packages for the frontend applications and a distinct backend service.



-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This is the core FastAPI application. It defines all API routes, including the crucial  endpoints that forward form data to the external dashboard.
    -   **Changes**: This file was central to the entire trajectory. It was heavily modified to:
        1.  Disable legacy dashboard proxy routes.
        2.  Re-enable and reconfigure proxy routes for the new dashboard.
        3.  Debug authentication issues by correcting the  header and API key environment variable references.
        4.  Fix the root cause of false positive success messages by uncovering error-masking fallback logic.
        5.  Resolve Internal Server Error on deployment by removing hardcoded URLs and using environment variables.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Contains the job application form, the target of the initial user request.
    -   **Changes**: The file was intended to be refactored from a four-step form into a single-page form. However, debugging revealed that an old version of this file in a legacy  directory was causing confusion, and the single-page conversion was not properly implemented or served initially.

-   ** & **
    -   **Importance**: These files store all critical environment variables, including API endpoints and authentication keys. They were the primary source of integration failures.
    -   **Changes**: These files were updated multiple times to align the , , and  variables between the website and the dashboard's actual configuration, resolving multiple connection and authentication errors.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Configures the process manager (Supervisor) to run the frontend and backend services.
    -   **Changes**: This file was updated to point to the correct directory for the frontend service () after the monorepo was restructured, fixing a critical issue where the old frontend code was being served.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: A frontend configuration file that defines the API endpoints for form submissions.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to use the correct  endpoints after the new dashboard integration was enabled.

<pending_tasks>
- **Implement Advanced Dashboard Features**: The user has requested future implementation of advanced table features for the dashboard, including filtering, sorting, bulk status updates, and CSV export functionality.
- **Finalize UI/UX**: Implement a dark/light theme toggle for the dashboard.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed an extensive and deep investigation into why form submissions were not appearing in the live dashboard, despite the website's backend proxy returning success messages. The work involved debugging multiple layers of the integration between the website and the new dashboard.

**Key Findings & Fixes:**
1.  **Root Cause Identified**: The primary issue was graceful degradation logic in the backend proxy (). This logic was catching legitimate errors from the dashboard API (like  for missing fields in payloads), storing data in a local fallback, and returning a fake success response to the frontend. This masked the real problem.
2.  **Payload Validation Errors**: Direct testing against the dashboard API revealed that many test payloads were missing required fields, causing the  validation errors.
3.  **Configuration Hell Resolved**: A series of critical mismatches in environment variables between the website and dashboard were corrected. This included aligning , CORS origins, and the authentication .
4.  **Deployment Fix**: The final Internal Server Error on the deployed website backend () was resolved by removing hardcoded URLs and replacing them with environment variables, making the application production-ready.

The immediate last action was sending a full suite of five realistic, complete test submissions to the now-correctly-configured live dashboard to confirm the end-to-end data flow is finally working.
