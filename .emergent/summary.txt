The trajectory documents a complex and iterative development and debugging process. The initial task was to fix a non-functional Submit Application button. This led to the discovery of a misconfigured frontend environment variable (), which was corrected. Subsequently, the user reported severe visual glitches (shadow/overlay artifacts) and performance issues.

The engineer embarked on a multi-stage debugging effort. Initial attempts involved removing CSS classes, but the problem persisted. A deeper investigation, aided by a troubleshooter agent, revealed the true root cause: an unstable, experimental version of React () was in use. Downgrading React to a stable version () and cleaning up conflicting CSS finally resolved the visual artifacts.

Following this, a new task to optimize the site's poor PageSpeed score was initiated. This involved implementing code splitting, lazy loading, and script deferral. However, these changes introduced new build errors, most notably a persistent  issue and later a . The engineer also discovered they were working in the wrong directory ( instead of the active ).

The trajectory concludes with the user ordering a full rollback of the performance optimization changes to fix the new build-breaking error.

The primary goal is to ensure the SentraTech website (, IP ) is fully functional, performant, and bug-free for production use.

Initial requirements focused on fixing a critical bug where job applications were being lost due to a non-functional submit button. This was traced to an incorrect backend URL configuration in the frontend.

Subsequent requirements focused on resolving major UI/UX and performance problems:
1.  **Visual Glitches:** Eliminate severe visual artifacts, distortions, and laggy overlay/shadow effects on modals (Cookie Banner, Customer Journey, Contact Sales) and cards.
2.  **Performance:** Address extremely slow page load times and poor PageSpeed Insights scores, which were causing laggy scrolling and a poor user experience.
3.  **Deployment Stability:** Ensure the application can be successfully built and deployed to the production environment without errors.

The most recent and critical requirement is to revert a set of performance-enhancing changes that, while well-intentioned, introduced new, build-breaking syntax errors, preventing deployment. The immediate priority is to restore the application to a stable, deployable state.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **React:** Frontend library. A critical issue was resolved by downgrading from an unstable v19.0.0 to v18.3.1.
- **FastAPI:** Python framework for the backend server.
- **MongoDB Atlas:** The production database service, requiring the codebase to handle Atlas connection strings.
- **TailwindCSS:** Utility-first CSS framework used for styling. Many visual glitches were related to its effects.
- **CRACO:** Configuration layer for Create React App, used to modify webpack settings for performance optimization.
- **Yarn:** The required package manager for the frontend.
- **Environment Variables:** Crucial for configuration, especially  for API communication and secrets management.

<code_architecture>
The application is a monorepo with two distinct frontend directories discovered during the process, and a single backend. The supervisor was configured to run the  package, which became the focus of the final fixes.



-   ****: This file was central to fixing build issues. It was modified to downgrade React from  to , resolve peer dependency warnings by installing specific versions of  and , and fix the build script to prevent errors when the  directory already existed.
-   ** & **: These files were modified to address critical security vulnerabilities. Hardcoded secrets (JWT secret, API keys) were removed and replaced with calls to  to load them from environment variables, making the application safe for production deployment.
-   ****: Initially modified to add performance optimizations like code splitting. Later, a faulty  section causing build failures was identified and removed to resolve the persistent  error during deployment.
-   ****: This file was created to explicitly define a clean Babel configuration, which helped resolve transitive dependency issues that were causing the  build error.
-   ****: This was a key file modified during the performance optimization phase to implement lazy loading. These changes introduced a  and are currently being reverted.
-   **Numerous Components (, , etc.)**: Multiple component files across the frontend were edited to remove conflicting CSS classes (, , ) that were causing visual artifacts due to the React 19 conflict.
-   ** & **: The  files were updated multiple times. First, to correct the backend URL from a non-existent preview link to . Second, to add the new environment variables for the secrets that were removed from the backend code.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the reversion of all performance-related changes made to the frontend codebase. This includes reverting modifications to , , and deleting newly created utility files.
- Ensure the application builds successfully after the reversion.
- Re-evaluate the strategy for performance optimization once the application is in a stable, deployable state.

<current_work>
The immediate task is a **critical rollback**. A recent attempt to optimize the website's performance, based on PageSpeed Insights, introduced a build-breaking syntax error: . This error is preventing the application from being deployed.

The user has explicitly ordered all changes related to this performance optimization effort to be reversed.

The previous engineer had already begun this process by:
1.  Deleting the  and  utility files.
2.  Deleting the  file.
3.  Reverting the  file to its pre-optimization state.
4.  Reverting the  file.

The work stopped right before reverting the changes in the application's entry points and components (like ) where lazy loading and other optimizations were implemented. The primary goal is to get the application back to a stable state that can pass the deployment build process.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
I will now complete the reversion process by reverting the changes in  and  to remove the performance optimizations that are causing the build to fail.
