The trajectory outlines an extensive series of iterative development and debugging tasks on the SentraTech website. The work began by confirming the stability of the application after a previous rollback. The engineer then addressed a user request to fix the newsletter subscription UI, which involved removing duplicate success messages and implementing a cleaner button-state change.

Subsequently, the majority of the work focused on numerous updates to the . This included changing timeline dates, completely revamping the Founding Team section with new members, photos, and a 2x2 layout, applying complex styling changes (colors, fonts, black-and-white image filters), and reorganizing the Investment Terms section.

Throughout these changes, a persistent issue was noted where local builds and restarts did not reflect on the production URL, suggesting deployment or caching problems. The engineer addressed a misconfiguration in , changing the build command from npm <command>

Usage:

npm install        install all the dependencies in your project
npm install <foo>  add the <foo> dependency to your project
npm test           run this project's tests
npm run <foo>      run the script named <foo>
npm <command> -h   quick help on <command>
npm -l             display usage info for all commands
npm help <term>    search for help on <term>
npm help npm       more involved overview

All commands:

    access, adduser, audit, bugs, cache, ci, completion,
    config, dedupe, deprecate, diff, dist-tag, docs, doctor,

The final phase involved cleaning up the UI by removing all Admin buttons and routes for security, and updating social media icons. However, when attempting to deploy all accumulated changes, a critical, deployment-blocking build error emerged: . The trajectory concludes with the engineer, guided by a troubleshooter agent, beginning to investigate the root cause of this syntax error.

<product_requirements>
The primary objective is to finalize the SentraTech website for production deployment by implementing a series of UI/UX improvements, content updates, and critical bug fixes.

**Completed & In-Progress Requirements:**
1.  **Newsletter Subscription Fix:** The user reported that the newsletter subscription button produced two confusing success messages (one green, one red). The requirement was to remove these messages and replace them with a simple tick icon appearing on the button itself upon successful submission.
2.  **Investor Relations Page Overhaul:** This page required multiple, detailed updates:
    *   **Content:** Update multiple timeline dates across different sections (e.g., 2024 to 2025, then to 2026/2027) and change the funding target from .5M to 0k.
    *   **Team Section:** Replace the existing team members with a new list (CEO, CTO, CHRO, COO), update their photos, and change the layout to a 2x2 grid.
    *   **Styling:** Apply specific visual changes, including changing title colors to matrix green, increasing font sizes for readability, making titles bold, and converting all team photos to black and white.
    *   **Layout:** Reorganize the Investment Opportunity section to be more visually appealing and clean.
3.  **UI & Security Cleanup:**
    *   Remove all Admin buttons and links from the entire public-facing website.
    *   Update the social media icons in the footer, replacing the Twitter icon with an 'X' icon and adding a new Facebook icon with the correct link.
    *   Remove admin and search buttons from the main navigation header and improve spacing.
4.  **Deployment Fix:** The most critical requirement is to resolve the build failure that prevents any of the above changes from being deployed to the production environment ().

<key_technical_concepts>
- **React:** The frontend is built using the React library.
- **TailwindCSS:** Used for all styling and layout. The majority of UI changes involved modifying Tailwind utility classes.
- **CRACO (Create React App Configuration Override):** Used to customize the webpack build process.
- **Yarn:** The designated package manager for the frontend project. A key issue was fixed by aligning the deployment script to use Yarn instead of npm.
- **Emergent Platform:** The application is deployed via the Emergent platform, which handles containerization and deployment to a Kubernetes environment based on the  file.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a monorepo structure with a backend and a primary frontend package.



- ****
    - **Importance:** This was the central file for the majority of the user's requests. It contains the layout, content, and styling for the entire investor relations section.
    - **Changes:** This file was heavily modified to: update text for timelines and funding goals; restructure the  data array with new members and image paths; change the JSX rendering to a 2x2 grid for the team section; and add numerous TailwindCSS classes to adjust colors, font sizes, boldness, and apply a  filter to images. Layouts were also reorganized using  and  classes.

- ****
    - **Importance:** This component handles the newsletter sign-up functionality.
    - **Changes:** The code was altered to remove the display of success/error message divs. The call to a  function was removed to prevent a duplicate notification, streamlining the UI to only show a state change on the button itself.

- ****
    - **Importance:** This is the main application component that defines the routing structure.
    - **Changes:** The import and route definitions for the  were removed to prevent direct URL access, enhancing security. The import and usage of the  component were also removed.

- ** & **
    - **Importance:** These components define the site-wide header and footer.
    - **Changes:**  was modified to remove a text link to the admin page and to update the social media icon set (changing Twitter to X and adding Facebook).  was modified to remove the admin and search buttons and to adjust the spacing of navigation links.

- ****
    - **Importance:** This file configures the production deployment process for the Emergent platform.
    - **Changes:** The build command for the website package was corrected from  to yarn install v1.22.22

3.  Received a detailed diagnostic from a troubleshooter agent pinpointing the issue as a duplicate declaration of the  identifier, likely stemming from an import/export conflict or a duplicate definition in a single file.

The work stopped right as the engineer began investigating the codebase, specifically the  file and other files using the  hook, to locate and eliminate the source of this duplicate declaration. The primary goal is to fix this syntax error to enable a successful production deployment.
