The AI engineer's work primarily focused on three key areas: enhancing the ROI Calculator, optimizing application performance, and refining navigation UI. Initially, the ROI Calculator was integrated with Supabase for report generation, successfully capturing user data. This was followed by multiple iterations of redesigning the ROI Calculator, updating its algorithm with new profit margins and per-call metrics, and implementing a modern UI with two-panel inputs for Agent Count and Average Handle Time. Extensive testing ensured mathematical accuracy and UI responsiveness. Concurrently, the engineer addressed performance issues by removing the Bengali language option, optimizing page transitions, replacing heavy WebGL/Three.js components with lighter alternatives, and disabling problematic error tracking. Finally, significant effort was dedicated to fixing the hamburger menu's transparency and ensuring a floating quick-access navigation button, eventually implementing a scrollable glassmorphism-styled floating navigation based on detailed user instructions.

The SentraTech application aims to be a high-conversion, dark-themed AI + BI customer support platform with a sleek UI, Matrix Green accents, glass-morphism, Rajdhani font, custom particle cursor, and rich animations. It includes CRM-integrated contact forms (Supabase), Emergent LLM chat, dynamic KPI counters, and a multi-page structure. Security, SEO, performance, and accessibility have been foundational. The ROI Calculator evolved into a multi-country tool (Bangladesh, India, Philippines, Vietnam) with market-research-backed baselines, simplified inputs, and an elegant UI, currently saving detailed reports to Supabase with user email. Recent requests focused on a slick, ultra-modern ROI calculator design, performance optimization for smooth page transitions, and a consistently floating quick-access hamburger navigation button.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing a new scrollable floating navigation button. The user requested to replace the previously fixed circular floating button with a truly floating quick-access menu that scrolls naturally with page content, irrespective of page or scroll position. This involved creating a new component, , which uses  for relative positioning within the document flow, applying specific glassmorphism styling, and setting up JavaScript to toggle an expanded menu with animations. The engineer successfully created and integrated this new component into , replacing the older . The last action was to restart the frontend and subsequently test the newly implemented scrollable floating navigation to ensure it is visible, correctly styled, and expands on click. The button is now visible and styled as specified.
