The AI engineer's work spanned multiple critical UI/UX improvements and feature enhancements for the SentraTech application. Initial efforts focused on refining the ROI Calculator's algorithm and UI, optimizing application performance by replacing heavy components and disabling problematic tracking, and redesigning the main navigation. A significant portion of the trajectory involved implementing and iteratively debugging a new scrollable floating navigation menu, fixing numerous homepage navigation links and hash-scrolling issues across different pages, and reverting a customer journey component. Later, the engineer enhanced the ROI Calculator's email submission confirmation, streamlined the Demo Request page by removing duplicate content and optimizing spacing, and critically, implemented a Contact Sales slide-in panel for the pricing page with Supabase integration. The most recent efforts revolve around addressing persistent modal positioning issues for the customer journey interactive cards and a new revamp request for the Contact Sales panel, which currently suffers from Supabase submission errors and poor initial positioning. Extensive debugging, refactoring of components, and adherence to user-specific styling and functionality were common throughout.

<product_requirements>
The SentraTech app is a high-conversion, dark-themed AI + BI customer support platform. Key requirements include a sleek UI with Matrix Green accents, glass-morphism, Rajdhani font, particle cursor, and rich animations. It integrates CRM forms (Supabase), LLM chat, and dynamic KPI counters. The ROI Calculator evolved into a multi-country tool (Bangladesh, India, Philippines, Vietnam) with market-research-backed baselines, saving detailed reports to Supabase. Recent focus included an ultra-modern ROI calculator design, smooth page transitions, and a consistently floating quick-access navigation button. Subsequently, fixes were requested for homepage navigation (linking to correct pages/sections), reverting Customer Journey UI, enhancing ROI email submission confirmation, cleaning up the Demo Request page by removing redundant sections and optimizing spacing, and implementing a Contact Sales slide-in panel for the pricing page with Supabase integration. The latest request is a complete revamp of the Contact Sales panel to fix positioning, remove redundant buttons from pricing cards, and refine styling/accessibility.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with implementing a Contact Sales slide-in panel for the pricing page, integrating it with Supabase. The engineer successfully created the  component, integrated it into  and , and added a backend notification endpoint in . A Supabase setup script () was also created. Frontend testing showed a 95% success rate, and backend testing confirmed 100% success.

However, the user has now reported critical issues:
1.  **Supabase Integration Failure**: The form displays Failed to submit contact request. Please try again.
2.  **Modal Positioning Issue**: The slide-in panel (currently a popup) appears at the top of the page, requiring the user to scroll up, which is a poor user experience.
3.  **Pricing Card Button Cleanup**: Remove Start Free Trial from Starter, Request Demo from Growth, and a duplicate Contact Sales from Enterprise.

The user has provided a new, comprehensive prompt for revamping the Contact Sales interaction and tier cards, detailing exact inline slide-over panel behavior, positioning, accessibility, button styling, form layout, and submission UX. The AI engineer has acknowledged these issues and the new prompt.
