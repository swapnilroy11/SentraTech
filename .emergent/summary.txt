The trajectory chronicles a comprehensive development cycle, evolving from bug fixing to feature implementation and deep system optimization. The initial task was to repair a non-functional admin dashboard login, a process that uncovered and resolved fundamental configuration issues with Supervisor, which was pointing to an outdated directory structure. Following this, the project pivoted to a major UI/UX overhaul based on user-provided visual specifications, implementing a dark theme with vibrant neon green accents across the dashboard.

A significant portion of the work involved preparing for an enterprise-grade production deployment. This included restructuring the monorepo, creating a robust backend proxy with idempotency, implementing a WebSocket service for real-time data synchronization, and configuring production URLs. However, this led to a critical phase of debugging platform-specific deployment issues, revealing a misunderstanding of the deployment process and forcing a refactor to make the application environment-aware.

The final phase focused on fine-grained user experience enhancements. The AI engineer addressed and fixed issues with delayed landing page animations by implementing instant CSS fallbacks, resolved a lagging cookie modal, and performed extensive mobile optimization. This included making the navigation menu full-screen, removing an unwanted floating menu, and optimizing performance on the ROI calculator page. The work concludes with the AI poised to refactor the multi-step job application form into a single, streamlined page, per the user's latest request.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal is to build, deploy, and maintain the SentraTech application, which consists of a public-facing website and a secure, enterprise-grade administrative dashboard.

**Core Features:**
1.  **Unified Monorepo:** The website and dashboard applications are consolidated into a single  directory for streamlined development and deployment.
2.  **Secure Data Proxy:** All form submissions from the website are routed through a secure, idempotent FastAPI backend proxy to prevent data loss and duplication.
3.  **Enterprise Admin Dashboard:** A feature-rich dashboard built with React, providing administrators with real-time data visualization. Key features include KPI cards, data charts, and detailed submission tables. It is designed with a specific dark theme complemented by neon green accents (#00FF41).
4.  **Real-Time Functionality:** The dashboard must display new form submissions in real-time, achieved through a WebSocket connection.
5.  **Optimized User Experience:** The public website must be highly performant, with instant-loading animations and a fully responsive, mobile-first design. All interactive elements, including modals and navigation, must be optimized for all devices.
6.  **Production Deployment:** The final application will be deployed to custom domains, with the website at  and the dashboard at .

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Monorepo Architecture**: Manages the , , and  projects within a unified  directory, now structured under .
- **FastAPI Backend**: Serves as a secure API gateway, a proxy for form submissions, and hosts the WebSocket server for real-time communication.
- **React & Tailwind CSS**: Used for building modern, responsive, and visually consistent user interfaces for both the website and the dashboard.
- **Framer Motion**: The primary library for implementing complex animations, enhanced with custom hooks and CSS fallbacks for optimal performance.
- **Supervisor**: Manages background processes, ensuring the backend, website, and dashboard services are always running.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a monorepo architecture, recently restructured to place frontend applications inside a  directory to align with modern deployment configurations.



-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This file contains the multi-step job application form. It is the focus of the current development task.
    -   **Changes**: The immediate next step is to refactor this component to remove the four-step journey and consolidate all form fields into a single, scrollable page.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: The main landing page of the website, featuring several animated sections.
    -   **Changes**: This file was heavily modified to fix animation loading delays. Instant CSS animations were added to run immediately on page load while the  library initializes, ensuring a smooth user experience.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Handles the website's main navigation, including the mobile hamburger menu.
    -   **Changes**: The mobile menu styling was updated to be full-screen () to improve the user experience on smaller devices.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: The core FastAPI application. It handles all API routes, database interactions, and service initializations.
    -   **Changes**: It was significantly enhanced to integrate the new enterprise proxy () and the WebSocket service (), preparing it for production deployment with real-time capabilities.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Manages the lifecycle of all application services (backend, website, dashboard).
    -   **Changes**: This file was debugged and corrected multiple times to fix port conflicts, point to the correct application directories ( and ), and ensure stable service operation.

<pending_tasks>
- **Implement Advanced Table Features**: Add filtering, sorting, bulk status updates, and CSV export functionality to the dashboard's data tables as per the original enterprise specification.
- **Finalize UI/UX**: Implement the dark/light theme toggle for the dashboard.
- **Complete Real-Time Integration**: Ensure the WebSocket connection is robust and seamlessly updates the dashboard with live data in the production environment.
- **Final Deployment and Domain Configuration**: Guide the user through the final steps of deploying on the platform and configuring the  and  domains.

<current_work>
The immediate task is to refactor the job application process on the SentraTech website. The user has requested to eliminate the existing four-step form journey within the  component. The goal is to create a more streamlined user experience by consolidating all required input fields into a single, continuous form. This new form will appear on the same page directly below the job description.

The AI engineer has successfully identified the target file for this modification: . The last action taken was locating this file and analyzing its current structure, which uses a state machine and conditional rendering to display different steps. The next action will be to modify the JSX and state management logic within this component to render all form sections sequentially on one page, removing the Next Step and Previous Step buttons and associated logic. This change aims to simplify the application process and improve usability, particularly on mobile devices.
