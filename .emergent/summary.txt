The previous AI engineer spent significant effort resolving persistent routing, CORS, and authentication issues to ensure all 6 website forms reliably submit data to the external SentraTech Admin Dashboard. The work trajectory shows a shift from direct API calls (which failed due to routing) to a robust **server-to-server proxy** solution implemented in FastAPI. Key fixes involved hardening this proxy by: 1) implementing client-side rate limiting and server-side idempotency (using unique IDs and a 60-second window) to prevent duplicate submissions, 2) refining CORS middleware and adding  handlers in the backend, and 3) securely forwarding the  via the proxy. The final challenge was addressing the instability caused by dynamic session URLs, which led to configuring the entire application—frontend environment, backend CORS, and proxy origin—to use the user's permanent custom domain, . The current state is blocked awaiting SSL certificate provisioning for the new domain.

The SentraTech application requires robust, high-conversion functionality for multiple forms (Demo Request, ROI Calculator, Contact Sales, Newsletter, Job Application) and the Sentra AI chat widget. The primary goal is reliable, authenticated data ingestion into the external SentraTech Admin Dashboard.

Initial failures led to the implementation of a server-to-server proxy architecture to bypass browser-side CORS and routing complexities. Recent requirements focused on ensuring data integrity and stability:
1. Implement client-side rate limiting and server-side idempotency to prevent form submission flooding.
2. Securely authenticate all proxy traffic using an API key ().
3. Correctly map and capture complex form data, especially calculated values (ROI) and multi-step inputs (Job Application).
4. Resolve the critical issue of connection breakage due to dynamic session URLs by transitioning the entire application configuration (frontend URL, backend CORS, proxy origin) to the user's custom domain, .

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Proxy Architecture**: FastAPI backend acting as an authenticated server-to-server relay using .
- **API Security**: Secure forwarding of  via  header.
- **Data Integrity**: Client-side rate limiting and server-side idempotency (using unique request IDs, HTTP 429) to prevent duplicate form submissions.
- **CORS Management**: Explicit origin whitelisting and  preflight handling in FastAPI middleware.
- **React State Management**: Capturing complex, calculated form data from React state/components.

<code_architecture>

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Stores backend configuration and secure API keys.
    -   **Changes**: Added  (securely storing the key provided by the user) and updated  to  for the final domain transition.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Contains the core FastAPI logic, API routes, and the critical server-to-server proxy.
    -   **Changes**: Refined  to whitelist  and enabled . Explicit  handlers were added for all  endpoints. The  function was updated to read  from the environment and securely forward it as the  header. Server-side idempotency was implemented using an in-memory dictionary to reject duplicate requests within a 60-second window (HTTP 429).
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Defines the target URL for all frontend API calls.
    -   **Changes**: Updated  to the new custom domain .
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Centralizes form submission logic, network configuration, and retry mechanics.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented  with configurable . The  function was updated to correctly construct proxy URLs using  and ensures  for browser requests. A logging helper () was added for debugging. Submission logic was updated to use a persistent  for idempotency checks.
-   ** (Form Components)**:
    -   **Importance**: Handle user input and trigger data submission.
    -   **Changes**: All components were switched to use . ROI Calculator was significantly updated to capture calculated results from React state. Job Application components were enhanced for multi-step data aggregation and precise field mapping according to dashboard schema. Client-side state management was added to prevent multiple submissions (disabling buttons/showing loading state).

<pending_tasks>
- Complete synchronized-style particle cursor trail.
- Lazy-loading and critical CSS inlining.
- Debug service worker registration.
- UI Enhancements: Newsletter Subscribers management, Active Contracts page, and update routing/navigation for new admin pages.
- Implement Part 2: Video Pitch guidelines.
- **Critical Task**: Await SSL certificate provisioning for  and verify end-to-end functionality across all 6 forms using the custom domain.

<current_work>
The immediate work focused on permanently solving the dashboard connectivity issue caused by dynamic session URLs. The AI engineer successfully gathered the user's custom domain () and updated all configurations across the stack:
1.  **Backend Configuration (, )**: Updated CORS origins and proxy configuration to reference .
2.  **Frontend Configuration (, )**: Updated  and submission logic to point to the new domain.
3.  **DNS Records**: The user successfully added A and CNAME records pointing  to the application's external IP/host.

The last few messages confirm that the custom domain is resolving via DNS, but connection attempts (using  and screenshot tools) are failing due to SSL handshake errors. This is a typical temporary state while the SSL certificate is provisioning. The engineer is currently waiting for the infrastructure to stabilize before performing final functional tests. All critical application logic (rate limiting, idempotency, API key forwarding, and form data mapping) is implemented and internally tested as functional.

Wait a few minutes for the SSL certificate to provision and then re-test  connectivity via  and frontend screenshot.
