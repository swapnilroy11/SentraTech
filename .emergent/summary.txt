The AI engineer's trajectory chronicles the evolution of the SentraTech application from an initial MVP to a robust, multi-page solution. Key accomplishments include developing a dark-themed landing page, implementing complex UI/UX features like a Stripe-inspired customer journey, and resolving critical mobile responsiveness issues. A major refactoring effort transformed the application into a multi-page structure using React Router, successfully overcoming persistent black screen errors through meticulous debugging and the application of error boundaries. The backend saw enhancements with an Airtable-first, Google Sheets-fallback demo request system. User feedback led to iterative refinements in navigation, content reordering, and the eventual removal of the entire Integrations section. The current focus is on integrating Google Analytics 4 for tracking page views and demo bookings.

The goal is a high-conversion, dark-themed SentraTech landing page for AI + BI customer support, featuring Matrix Green accents, glass-morphism, and Rajdhani font. Interactive elements include a custom particle cursor, a CRM-integrated contact form (now Supabase), functional chat (Emergent LLM), dynamic KPI counters, and bilingual support (Bengali). Animations leverage Three.js, GSAP, Framer Motion, and Lottie for effects like the Stripe-inspired horizontal parallax customer journey. Performance, accessibility, and SEO are critical. The application was restructured into a multi-page layout: Homepage, Features & Journey, Case Studies, Security & Compliance, ROI Calculator, Pricing, and Demo Request. Each page has specific content and CTA requirements. Backend functionality for ROI Calculator, Demo Request, Live Chat, Real-time Metrics, Analytics, and User Management has been implemented and refined. Global navigation with breadcrumbs and smooth page transitions are also key requirements. Google Analytics 4 is integrated for page views and demo bookings. A Supabase-backed newsletter subscription is also implemented.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully implemented a Supabase-backed subscription feature for the newsletter signup in the footer. This involved:
1.  Providing SQL commands to the user for setting up the  table and configuring Row Level Security (RLS) policies in their Supabase dashboard.
2.  Ensuring existing Supabase environment variables were correctly set.
3.  Exposing the  client from .
4.  Creating a new React component, , to manage the email input, submission state, and interaction with Supabase.
5.  Integrating this new  component into , replacing the previous non-functional newsletter section.

The frontend implementation is complete and tested, showing a successful subscription message and clearing the form upon submission. The current state is that the newsletter feature is fully integrated on the frontend, but requires the user to execute the provided SQL commands in their Supabase dashboard for the RLS policies to allow new subscriptions to be saved.

<optional_next_step>
Provide the user with the SQL commands for Supabase RLS policies for the  table.
