The AI engineer's work primarily focused on enabling robust form submissions and AI chat functionality, initially tackling UI/UX, then persistent network issues. The core problem evolved from Failed to Fetch errors to unreliable  checks, and finally to a subtle environment-specific routing discrepancy. The engineer iteratively implemented local backend endpoints, external dashboard integrations, offline fallbacks, retry queues, and advanced network probes. A significant breakthrough came when it was identified that browser requests were hitting a different backend service (mock/staging) than server-side requests (real dashboard), despite appearing successful. After attempts to modify browser headers failed, the AI engineer shifted to a server-to-server proxy solution to bypass CORS and routing complexities. Concurrently, the engineer also completely rewrote the Investor Relations page and created a comprehensive 10-page pitch deck based on pre-seed startup best practices. The latest focus is on confirming the efficacy of the proxy solution with the user and clarifying the correct production API endpoint.

The SentraTech application, a dark-themed AI + BI customer support platform, aims for high conversion. Initial requirements included UI refinements (AI button, ROI Calculator, Contact Sales form) and secure data ingestion to a local backend, then forwarding to an external Admin Dashboard. The Careers page required a multi-step job application form.

Later, the core requirement shifted to integrating *all* website forms (Demo Request, ROI Calculator, Contact Sales, Newsletter, Job Application) directly with the external SentraTech Admin Dashboard for unified management. This involved specific data schemas and direct submission. Due to persistent deployment network issues, a temporary requirement emerged to make all forms and Sentra AI work without actual network calls, simulating success states. This was followed by reinstating network calls with robust fallback. A significant new request was to completely rewrite the Investor Relations page to reflect a genuine pre-seed startup seeking investment, including a CEO email. Subsequently, a 10-page downloadable pitch deck was requested, aligning with industry standards for pre-seed startups. The ongoing challenge is ensuring that all form submissions from the user's browser environment reliably reach the SentraTech Admin Dashboard.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer identified a critical environment/routing discrepancy: while server-side requests successfully reached the external SentraTech Admin Dashboard, browser-initiated requests were being routed to a different, non-persistent service (mock/staging backend). This explained why users were not seeing their data appear in the dashboard despite receiving success responses in the browser.

To resolve this fundamental routing issue and bypass CORS complexities, the AI engineer implemented a **server-to-server proxy solution**. This involved:
1.  **Creating **: A new Python module to handle forwarding requests.
2.  **Adding proxy endpoints to **: New  endpoints (e.g., ) were added to the local backend. These endpoints receive requests from the frontend and use  to forward them to the actual external dashboard API, ensuring the correct Origin header is sent from the server-side.
3.  **Updating **: The  was configured to point to the local backend's proxy endpoints.
4.  **Modifying all frontend form components and **: These components were updated to send their submissions to the newly created local backend proxy endpoints instead of directly to the external dashboard.
5.  **Setting  in **: Pointed to the local backend ().

The AI engineer has successfully tested this proxy solution internally, confirming that the local backend proxy forwards requests to the external dashboard and receives successful responses with unique IDs. Two test entries were provided ( and ) for the user to verify in their dashboard. The current state is that the AI agent is awaiting confirmation from the user regarding the presence of these test entries in their dashboard and clarification on the final production API base URL ( vs ).
