# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"

## test_plan:
##   current_focus:

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

(2) REST API Endpoints: POST /api/chat/message working with proper query parameters, GET /api/chat/session/{session_id}/history retrieving messages correctly with timestamps and ordering, limit parameter functional. (3) AI Integration: Emergent LLM with gpt-4o-mini model working excellently - generating contextually appropriate SentraTech responses with relevant terms (automation, 70%, cost savings, AI platform), response quality high (400-1200 characters), proper error handling. (4) Database Integration: MongoDB persistence working perfectly - chat sessions stored with UUIDs, messages saved with timestamps, chronological ordering maintained, content preservation verified. (5) Error Handling: Graceful handling of invalid session IDs and nonexistent sessions. ❌ MINOR ISSUE: WebSocket connection timing out during handshake - likely network/environment configuration issue, not code problem. REST API fallback working perfectly. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS: All core live chat functionality operational, AI responses contextually appropriate for SentraTech (mentioning key features, automation rates, cost savings), database integration solid, session management robust. WebSocket issue appears to be infrastructure-related rather than implementation problem."

This is a critical UX issue - users can submit empty forms without any feedback. Main agent needs to debug why validateForm() function and fieldErrors state are not working properly.

No red borders or error messages appear when submitting empty form. Individual field validation (onBlur) works correctly. (2) SUBMIT ANOTHER REQUEST PARTIALLY BROKEN - returns to form but doesn't clear previous data. WORKING CORRECTLY: Valid form submission, loading spinner, success page with reference ID, backend integration. ROOT CAUSE: State synchronization issue in form submission validation - fieldErrors state updates not triggering UI re-render with conditional CSS classes. Main agent needs to fix the validateAllFields() function to properly update UI state or investigate React state batching issues."

After comprehensive testing of all 4 scenarios in the review request: ❌ CRITICAL FAILURE: Empty form validation completely broken - no red borders, no error messages, no visual feedback for users when submitting empty form. This creates terrible UX where users get no indication of validation errors. ✅ WORKING: Individual field validation (onBlur), complete success workflow with loading spinner and reference ID display, edge cases, Submit Another Request functionality. ROOT CAUSE: validateAllFields() function still has React state batching issue - setFieldErrors() during form submission not updating UI state properly. The conditional CSS classes (border-red-500) are not being applied. Individual field validation works because it uses different state update pattern.

The validateAllFields() function is returning true for empty forms when it should return false. ✅ WORKING: Individual field validation (onBlur), complete success workflow, Submit Another Request functionality. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: This is NOT a React state batching issue as originally thought. The validation logic itself is fundamentally broken in validateAllFields() function. Despite flushSync implementation, the function incorrectly validates empty forms as valid. URGENT ACTION REQUIRED: Main agent must debug and fix the validateAllFields() function logic - it's not properly detecting empty required fields during form submission validation."
