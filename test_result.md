# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

(2) Form Validation: ✅ All form validation working perfectly - required fields (name, email, company) validated correctly, optional phone field validation functional, form submission blocked when validation fails. (3) Network Requests: ✅ POST requests successfully sent to Supabase REST API endpoint (/rest/v1/demo_requests), proper headers and authentication included. (4) CRITICAL DATABASE SCHEMA ERROR: ❌ Supabase returns 400 error with message 'Could not find the call_volume column of demo_requests in the schema cache' (PGRST204). The frontend code is trying to insert a 'call_volume' field that doesn't exist in the Supabase 'demo_requests' table schema. (5) Error Handling: ✅ Frontend properly catches and displays error messages to users ('Failed to submit demo request. Please try again.'). ROOT CAUSE: Database table 'demo_requests' in Supabase is missing the 'call_volume' column that the frontend code expects. The insertDemoRequest function in supabaseClient.js includes call_volume in the insert operation, but the database table doesn't have this column. SOLUTION REQUIRED: Either (A) Add 'call_volume' column to Supabase 'demo_requests' table, or (B) Remove call_volume from the frontend insertion code.

The Supabase table has RLS enabled but no policy allows anonymous inserts from the frontend. (5) ✅ Network Requests: Form properly sends POST requests to Supabase with correct authentication headers, but receives 401 Unauthorized due to RLS policies. ROOT CAUSE: The main agent's fix (removing call_volume) was successful, but the Supabase table has Row Level Security enabled without appropriate policies for anonymous inserts.

    message: "🚨 CRITICAL COMPONENT RENDERING ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Integrations, Security, and Pricing pages are rendering HOMEPAGE CONTENT instead of their own content. ROOT CAUSE: The imported components (IntegrationsShowcase, SecurityCompliance, PricingSection) are NOT rendering at all. These pages show homepage sections ('Customer Support as a Growth Engine', 'Experience Our Core Features', 'Why Choose SentraTech?') instead of their expected content. React Router is working correctly (URLs show /integrations, /security, /pricing), but the page components are somehow falling back to rendering HomePage content. EVIDENCE: (1) Integrations page missing all integration-specific content (no Salesforce, HubSpot, '50+ Platform Integrations' title, integration cards), (2) Security page missing compliance content (no SOC2, ISO27001, GDPR, AES-256), (3) Pricing page missing pricing tiers (no $399, 'Most Popular' badges, Starter plan). All three pages show identical 6669-character homepage content. URGENT: Main agent needs to investigate component import/export issues or build configuration problems causing these components to not render."

(2) X Button Closing: X button in menu header closes menu immediately with translate-x-full animation - FIXED and working perfectly. (3) Escape Key Closing: Escape key listener working correctly - menu closes immediately when Escape is pressed - FIXED and working perfectly. (4) Navigation Auto-close: Menu automatically closes when navigation items are clicked and routes change - FIXED and working perfectly. (5) Cross-Viewport Compatibility: All closing methods work consistently across iPhone SE (320px), iPhone 6/7/8 (375px), and iPhone XR (414px) viewports. ❌ MINOR ISSUE IDENTIFIED: (1) Overlay Closing: Dark overlay click is intercepted by menu element due to z-index layering - overlay click does not close menu. This appears to be a z-index/pointer-events issue where the mobile menu panel intercepts clicks intended for the overlay. ✅ CRITICAL FIXES CONFIRMED: All the main agent's implemented fixes are working perfectly - handleMenuClose(), handleOverlayClick(), Escape key listener, and route change auto-close are all functional. The mobile navigation is production-ready with 5/6 closing methods working flawlessly. Only overlay clicking needs minor CSS adjustment for pointer-events or z-index to prevent menu interception."

(6) Menu Positioning: Off-canvas slide-out panel from right side working perfectly, proper CSS classes (translate-x-full ↔ translate-x-0). ❌ CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND: (1) Menu Closing Broken: X button in menu header visible but does NOT close menu, overlay click does NOT close menu, menu stays open after navigation attempts. (2) Keyboard Navigation Issues: Menu opens via Enter key but Escape key does NOT close menu, Tab navigation through menu items not working properly. (3) Auto-close on Navigation: Menu does NOT automatically close after clicking navigation items. ROOT CAUSE: JavaScript event handlers for menu closing are not working properly - close button clicks and overlay clicks are not triggering menu close functionality. URGENT FIX REQUIRED: Main agent must debug and fix menu closing mechanisms as users cannot close the mobile menu once opened."/sections. This is a major UX issue preventing users from accessing key functionality. (2) Homepage Voice Agent Content: Multi-Channel Support card missing voice agent preview text on homepage (though voice agent content displays correctly on Features page). ⚠️ MINOR ISSUE: Integrations page loads but may have different content than expected. URGENT ACTION REQUIRED: Main agent must fix the floating navigation menu - the useNavigateWithScroll hook or navigation click handlers are not working properly for 8 out of 9 menu items, preventing users from accessing core features through the primary navigation interface."

    message: "🚨 FINAL CRITICAL VERIFICATION COMPLETE: React flushSync fix has FAILED to resolve the form validation issue. DETAILED FINDINGS: ❌ CRITICAL: Empty form validation completely broken - console logs show 'Validation result: true' for empty form (should be false), no red borders appear on fields, no error messages displayed. The validateAllFields() function is returning true for empty forms when it should return false. ✅ WORKING: Individual field validation (onBlur), complete success workflow, Submit Another Request functionality. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: This is NOT a React state batching issue as originally thought. The validation logic itself is fundamentally broken in validateAllFields() function.
